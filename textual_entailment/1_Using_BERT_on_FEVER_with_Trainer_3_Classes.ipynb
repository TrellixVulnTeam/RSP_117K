    "    A major shift is underway in the automotive industry. Carmakers are using new technologies to deliver on consumer expectations for the same connectivity in their cars as they’ve come to expect in their homes and offices. From dashboard computing to In-Vehicle-Infotainment (IVI), automobiles are becoming the latest wireless devices – on wheels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Linux operating system is providing a common platform that helps connect the world’s network of devices, including cars. As an open source operating system, it provides automakers and their partners the flexibility they require to bring to market the latest technology features quickly.\n",

    "    “Linux gives us the flexibility and technology maturity we require to evolve our In-Vehicle-Infotainment and communications systems to address the expectations of our customers,” said Kenichi Murata, Project General Manager, Electronics Development Div. 1, TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION. “The Linux Foundation provides us with a neutral forum in which we can collaborate with the world’s leading technology companies on open innovation that accelerates that evolution.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    “We are very pleased to welcome Toyota to The Linux Foundation. The company’s leadership and proven innovation will bring important contributions to the advancement of Linux,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director at The Linux Foundation. ‘Toyota’s investment in Linux is a testament to the ubiquity of the operating system and its ability to support the latest market requirements.”\n",

    "    About The Linux Foundation\n",
    "    The Linux Foundation is a nonprofit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux. Founded in 2000, the organization sponsors the work of Linux creator Linus Torvalds and promotes, protects and advances the Linux operating system by marshaling the resources of its members and the open source development community. The Linux Foundation provides a neutral forum for collaboration and education by hosting Linux conferences, including LinuxCon, and generating original Linux research and content that advances the understanding of the Linux platform. Its web properties, including Linux.com, reach approximately two million people per month and include important Linux video resources. The organization also provides extensive Linux training opportunities that feature the Linux kernel community’s leading experts as instructors. Follow The Linux Foundation on Twitter.\n",
