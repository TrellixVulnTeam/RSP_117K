The contents of this folder have been moved to another repository, [WD_Textual_References_Dataset](https://github.com/gabrielmaia7/WD_Textual_References_Dataset), in which this task was taken as a bigger task of obtaining a suitable HTML-to-Text Wikidata Dataset for fact verification.

Firstly, no boilerplate removal was performed. We are trusting on the combination of the sentence selection module with a clean retrieval of well-formatted and significant natural language sentences to filter in important pieces of evidence, without the need to detect low-information and poor-formatted sentences in the HTML itself.

The final dataset created in [WD_Textual_References_Dataset](https://github.com/gabrielmaia7/WD_Textual_References_Dataset) was copied to this folder, and it will be where the pipeline will be tested on.
